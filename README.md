# Project Name : yir

### Year in Review (YIR for short).

_The days are long, but the years are short_

## Project Overview

**premise**

- Every new years eve, we sit down as a family and look back on the year that passed. This app is an attempt to recreate the collage of tools we have used so far. We remember the good, the bad and everything we have faced through the year\*

Users can register, and begin to create memories. Memories are stored and kept in order by date. User can CRUD memories.

#### Memories

Memories includes

- date
- Heading
- description
  TODO: link for picture to be included.

#### SCRUM board

#### Credit where Credit is due

The idea for the app is ruthlessly and shamelessly copied from the Chingu project
[Chingu Solo Project - Tier 3 - Journal App] (https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier3-journal-app)
I have only added a very thin veneer of originality, as I have indeed been doing Year in Reviews with my family using a combination of tools...
but why waiste 5 minuttes using sub-par tools, when I can labouriously over-engineer a solution in just a few days.
